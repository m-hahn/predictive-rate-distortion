# Code for running NPRD

## Scripts

`nprd_...` files run a single run of NPRD.

`runNPRD...` files run a batch of NPRD on a given process, with different random choices of hyperparameters.



## Prerequisites:

* See parent directory for prerequisites.
* Clone the repository `https://github.com/m-hahn/torchkit` and create a symbolic link to directory `torchkit/` here. This repository contains files due to Huang et al., 2018, needed for running Neural Autoregressive Flows.
