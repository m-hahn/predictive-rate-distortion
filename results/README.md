# Raw results

* `results-nrpd.tsv`: Raw results for NPRD on analytically known processes and POS-level English
* `results-nprd-words.tsv`: Raw results for NPRD on word-level modeling of natural language
* `results-oce.tsv`: Raw results for OCE

The `outputs-...` directories are used by the NPRD and OCE scripts to deposit results; these can be summarized into TSV files using the scripts in `../code/collectResults/` (which will overwrite the TSV files here).
